      ~ The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a
      muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and
      round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
      dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most
      recognisable feature of the species. With a typical head-to-body length of
      184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72
      in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride
      consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female
      lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion
      is an apex and keystone predator, although some lions scavenge when
      opportunities occur, and have been known to hunt humans, although the
      species typically does not. ~ <br />
