        <h1>BERLIN</h1>
        <p>
          The German capital is a history packed city. Devastated at the end of World War II and 
          divided by a Wall for 28 years, Berlin regains its former splendor at great strides.
          The contemporary buildings erase the city’s difficult past to create a unique atmosphere, 
          where vintage blends pleasantly with the state-of-the-art, and the outlandish complements the everyday. <br>
          The vestige of the Berlin Wall makes an emotive open-air museum, where visitors can relive moments 
          of anguish and horror by discovering numerous true stories about families that were separated for years. <br>
          The death camps expose the best kept secrets on the consequences of a fascist regime and the bunkers transmit 
          the terror that one day kept the city hidden by fear.
          There is a wide variety of activities, day trips and excursions in Berlin that will wrap visitors up in its 
          complex history.
